                    Anime is a distinctive style of Japanese animation that has gained global popularity, characterized by its unique art,
                    storytelling, and cultural themes.

                    Anime (Japanese: アニメ; IPA: [aꜜɲime] ⓘ;[a] derived from a shortening of the English word animation) is hand-drawn and
                    computer-generated animation originating from Japan. Outside Japan and in English, anime refers specifically to
                    animation produced in Japan.[1] However, anime, in Japan and in Japanese, describes all animated works, regardless of
                    style or origin. Many works of animation with a similar style to Japanese animation are also produced outside Japan.
                    Video games sometimes also feature themes and art styles that may be labelled as anime.

                    The earliest commercial Japanese animation dates to 1917. A characteristic art style emerged in the 1960s with the works
                    of cartoonist Osamu Tezuka and spread in the following decades, developing a large domestic audience. Anime is
                    distributed theatrically, through television broadcasts, directly to home media, and over the Internet. In addition to
                    original works, anime are often adaptations of Japanese comics (manga), light novels, or video games. It is classified
                    into numerous genres targeting various broad and niche audiences.[2]
